# Questionnaire-selection

This code is used to select the questionnaire that deals with the most principles and rights of the GDPR.  

We provide the necessary documents (5 questionnaires and the document "GDPR key terms") 

This code has been executed on Google colab. However, you can use another tool. Just think about: 

1 - Load the documents.

2 - two cells for pre-processing and two cells for loading models are available. You need to run one cell of each depending on the test you want to perform. 

3 - In case of error when importing the models (word2vec and fastText) think of modifying the path
